        "   - Title cell and short description with GOV.UK reference.\n",
        "   - Table of contents (links to sections).\n",
        "   - Sections: Setup, Functions, Examples, CSV Loader, Interactive Demo, Unit Tests, Export/Save.\n",
        "   - Provide clear instructions in Markdown for how to run each section.\n",

        "\n",
        "2) Calculation functions (in a module and shown inline)\n",
        "   - Implement modular, well-documented functions:\n",
        "       * calc_avg_holiday_pay_days(pay_elements: list[float], reference_periods:int, frequency:str, working_days_in_week:int) -> float\n",

        "\n",
        "5) Interactive demo cell (Colab form or simple input())\n",
        "   - Provide a cell that allows the user to input parameters (using `input()` or `ipywidgets` / `google.colab.widgets`) and then prints the chosen calculation and results with the audit lines (each step).\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Unit tests\n",
        "   - Include a `tests/` cell using `pytest` or simple assert-based tests for:\n",
        "       - basic calculation correctness for each function,\n",
        "       - edge cases (empty lists, missing hours, invalid frequency),\n",
        "       - at least one salaried annual vs period example.\n",
        "   - Show how to run tests in Colab and display test results.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) Export & handoff\n",
        "   - Save `payroll_calc.py` module.\n",
        "   - Save example CSVs to the Colab filesystem.\n",
        "   - Create a ZIP (`tools_for_dev.zip`) including the Python module, sample CSVs, and a README describing the functions and how to run the code locally.\n",

        "\n",
        "8) Code quality & comments\n",
        "   - Keep code modular, readable, and commented — include brief legal note referencing GOV.UK and IRIS methodology (no proprietary text).\n",
        "   - Add a short README cell that documents input expectations and a quick-start instruction for developers to convert the module into a CLI or integrate into an app.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) Deliverables (explicit)\n",
        "   - payroll_calc.py module with the requested functions.\n",
